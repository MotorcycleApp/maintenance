<p>Generally speaking heavier flyball gives you a higher top speed but considering the scooter weight that the flyball can be lighter or heavier. Usually ended up choosing from 9 grams to 13 grams flyball. Combination is a bit confusing but can be test from pulling some combinations from your own. You can also combine different size but for the maximum of 2 size only, example is you combine three 10 grams flyball and three 12 grams flyball. It is recommended if you want to balance your acceleration and top speed. But remember that heavy flyball can make your scooter loose its acceleration. Try different combinations and hope that you will find your right taste of flyballs sizes.</p>

<p>In terms of lighter flyball, they gives you high acceleration but bot that high in means of top speed. Best sizes for small riders and light scooters. The size will vary from 7 grams to 9 grams and will depend on your choice of combination. Try to vary the size by 1 gram each combination so you can come up with a combination that is suitable for you and your comfortability while running.</p>
